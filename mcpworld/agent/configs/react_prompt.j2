{{INSTRUCTION}}

{{TOOLS_PROMPT}}

You need to answer the following question:

Question: {{QUESTION}}

Your goal is to reason about the question and decide on the best course of action to answer it accurately.
You need to choose the appropriate tool based on the question. If no tool is needed, reply directly.
Please use only the tools that are explicitly defined above.

{% if CONTEXT_EXAMPLES is defined and CONTEXT_EXAMPLES|length %}
### Examples ###
{{CONTEXT_EXAMPLES}}
### End of examples ###
{% endif %}

{% if HISTORY is defined and HISTORY|length %}
Previous reasoning steps and observations:
{{HISTORY}}
{% else %}
Previous reasoning steps and observations: EMPTY
{% endif %}

Instructions:
1. Analyze the query, previous reasoning steps, and observations.
2. Decide on the next action: use a tool or provide a final answer.
3. Respond in the following JSON format:

If you need to use a tool:
{
    "thought": "Your detailed reasoning about what to do next",
    "action": {
        "reason": "Explanation of why you chose this tool",
        "server": "server-name",
        "tool": "tool-name",
        "arguments": {
            "argument-name": "argument-value"
        }
    }
}

If you have enough information to answer the query:
{
    "thought": "Your final reasoning process",
    "answer": "Your comprehensive answer to the query"
}

Remember:
- Be thorough in your reasoning.
- Use tools when you need more information.
- Always base your reasoning on the actual observations from tool use.
- If a tool returns no results or fails, acknowledge this and consider using a different tool or approach.
- Provide a final answer only when you're confident you have sufficient information.
- If you cannot find the necessary information after using available tools, admit that you don't have enough information to answer the query confidently.
- The response must be in a JSON format.
